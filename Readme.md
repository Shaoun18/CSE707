== Project Overview ==

This repository focuses on the exploration of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and the development of advanced security techniques for their detection and mitigation. The project combines research insights with practical implementation using machine learning approaches, particularly LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) models, to enhance the precision and robustness of DDoS attack detection.
